name: Deploy to Remote via Tailscale

# Pieces needed for this to work:
# 1. COMPLETE A Tailscale account and a machine (RCP) set up with Tailscale
# 2. COMPLETE An OAuth app created in Tailscale for GitHub Actions
#    - Follow instructions here: https://tailscale.com/kb/1191/github-actions
# 3. COMPLETE A Tailscale auth key (can be ephemeral?) created in the Tailscale admin console
# 4. COMPLETE SSH access set up on the target machine (RCP)
#    - Ensure the SSH public key is added to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file of the target user on the RCP
# 5. COMPLETEGitHub Secrets need to be configured:
#    - TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID: From the OAuth app created in Tailscale
#    - TS_OAUTH_SECRET: From the OAuth app created in Tailscale
#    - TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY: The Tailscale auth key
#    - SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: The private SSH key corresponding to the public key added to the RCP
#    - (100.67.178.115) TARGET_MACHINE_IP: The IP address of the target machine (RCP) as seen in Tailscale
#    - (student-admin, unless we want to change this to be more secure) REMOTE_USER: The username to use for SSH on the target machine (RCP)
